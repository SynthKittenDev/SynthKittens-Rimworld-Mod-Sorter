# SynthKitten's Rimworld Mod Sorter
This application will automagically rename all of the Mods in your Rimworld Steam Workshop folder. (.NET Framework 4.7.2 Required)

# Tutorial

1. Download the Application from the '[Releases](https://github.com/Donut-Cat/SynthKittens-Rimworld-Mod-Sorter/releases)' section.
2. Run the application, you may need to run it as administrator IF the program is unable to write files.
3. Your good to go! Everything should be done for you.

All of your mods will be renamed into a newly created 'Renamed_Mods' folder. Inside, all your mods will be backed up and renamed to their steam workshop title.

From here, you can easily find out what mods belong where and additionally, when used with the OpenWorld mod, allow for ease of finding what mods to add/remove without searching through hundreds of randomly numbered folders.

With love,
SynthKitten
